                    <p>These elves are very easy to identify as they are very tall, approximately 2 meters. They are skilled with swords and excellent mages. They stand out from the rest by the color of their hair, which is silver, their blue eyes, and their silver clothing with blue and gold details.</p>

                    <p>These elves stand out from the rest because they are shorter than the primordial ones, approximately 1.80 meters tall. They are excellent hunters and very skilled with nature magic, which they use to camouflage themselves, hunt, and gather resources. Their main characteristics are: golden hair, blue eyes, and green clothing with gold and silver details. They always carry their bows.</p>

                    <p>These elves are the most mysterious of all, as we do not have much information about them. However, from what little we know, they have pale white skin, eyes like a specter, their clothes are black with silver, and they emit a purple aura. They are excellent assassins and we still know little more about them...</p>
