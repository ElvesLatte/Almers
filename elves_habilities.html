        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>Elves can live up to 750 years. They mature at the same rate as humans, but their understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf claims maturity around 100 years of age.</p>

    <div class="trait-entry">
        <h4>Alignment</h4>
        <p>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They also value and protect others' freedom as much as their own, and typically lean toward good rather than evil. The drow are an exception: their exile to the Underdark has made them cruel and dangerous, usually leaning toward evil.</p>

        <h4>Trance</h4>
        <p>Elves do not sleep: they enter a state of deep meditation, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. When you enter a trance, your dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting, you gain the same benefits as 8 hours of rest for a human.</p>
