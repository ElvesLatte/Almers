    <h2>Unified Elf Overview</h2>
    <p style="color: #d9d9d9; font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 0 0 0; line-height: 1.5;">
        Elves are an ancient, graceful, and enduring people whose origins trace back to the earliest ages of the world. 
        Across many realms and mythologies, they are consistently depicted as beings of exceptional longevity, keen senses, 
        refined artistry, and a deep attunement to the unseen forces of creation.

    <h3 class="category-title">Nature & Longevity</h3>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <p>Elves mature physically at a pace similar to humans, but their understanding of adulthood extends far beyond bodily growth. Depending on the tradition, an elf might claim maturity anywhere between fifty and one hundred years of age. Their lifespans range from several centuries to true immortality; in many accounts, elves do not die of age but only of violence, grief, or the gradual fading of the will to live.</p>

    <h3 class="category-title">Appearance & Physiology</h3>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <p>Elves are usually slender, tall, and unusually beautiful, with men and women showing only subtle physical differences. Their senses—especially sight and hearing—are markedly sharper than those of humans. Many elves can travel long distances without leaving tracks, move with remarkable silence, and withstand hunger, cold, and harsh environments better than most mortal races.</p>

    <div class="trait-entry">
        <h4>The Trance</h4>
        <p>Some traditions describe elves entering a meditative "trance" instead of sleeping. This semi-conscious state replenishes the mind and body with only a few hours of rest and often brings vivid mental visions or introspective exercises.</p>

    <h3 class="category-title">Magic & Abilities</h3>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <p>Elves often possess skills that border on the magical:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
            <li>Crafting objects of supernatural refinement</li>
            <li>Heightened resistance to enchantments</li>
            <li>Natural aptitude for arcane or spiritual arts</li>
            <li>The ability to perceive hidden forces or subtle gestures known as gesture-code or "language of the hands"</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Their connection to primordial energies—whether the Song of the Ainur, the Feywild, or the magicka of Nirn—infuses them with innate resilience and grace.</p>

<div class="entry-box">
    <h3 class="category-title">Culture, Alignment & Society</h3>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <p>Elven cultures emphasize freedom, artistry, and self-expression. They tend toward benevolence, though some subraces—such as the drow or the darker strains of mer—have embraced cruelty or dangerous ambition due to long ages spent in exile or corruption.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <h4>Marriage & Bonds</h4>
        <p>Marriage is seen as a profound union of souls, often lasting for centuries or even eternally. Divorce and multiple marriages are nearly unheard of in many traditions.</p>

    <h3 class="category-title">Language & Communication</h3>
    <div class="trait-entry">
        <p>Elven languages are often complex, melodic, and ancient. Many groups use subtle gestures, finger positions, or facial cues as part of their communication—a refined "language of the hands" that conveys meaning beyond spoken words.</p>
