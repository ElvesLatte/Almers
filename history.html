      <h3>The Firstborn of the World</h3>

      <p>
        The Elves were the first beings to awaken beneath the stars. Long before humanity learned to speak,
        the elves already carved cities from crystal and stone, sang to the winds, and studied the deep laws
        of existence written into the bones of the Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elves do not age as mortals do. Once they reach physical maturity, their bodies remain unchanged.
        Time affects them only through memory, not decay. They may be slain by blade or magic,
        but never by old age.
      </p>

      <p>
        When an elf dies, the spirit does not vanish. It returns to the Hall Beyond the World,
        a silent place between existence and rebirth where souls rest until fate summons them again.
        Death is not the end for elves — it is only a long sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike humans, elves do not see time as something that passes. For them, time is a forest,
        where every memory grows like a living tree. Every failure, every victory, and every love
        continues forever within their minds.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Their natural gifts are undeniable:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>They see in darkness as if it were twilight.</li>
        <li>They hear heartbeats through stone and rain.</li>
        <li>They walk so lightly they leave no trace behind.</li>
        <li>Four hours of deep meditation replaces sleep.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Their beauty is not simple appearance, but the visible echo of divine origin.
        Wherever an elf walks, the world knows something ancient has passed through.

        <h3>☀️ Primordial Elves — The First Flame</h3>

        <p>
          The Primordial Elves are the origin of all elven bloodlines.
          Taller than the rest of their kind, they reach nearly two meters in height
          and move with the grace of living statues shaped by gods themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their silver hair gleams like forged moonlight and their deep blue eyes
          reflect ancient power. They are feared and admired alike, unmatched in blade work
          and terrifyingly skilled in arcane magic. Few beings dare challenge them in either art.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their clothing and armor shine with silver, blue, and golden detail,
          displaying their divine ancestry with every movement.
          Each Primordial is not merely noble — they are living royalty of a forgotten age.
        </p>

        <p>
          These elves once built empires that touched the heavens. Entire mountains were reshaped to become
          their cities, and the oceans themselves bowed before their spells. Dragons served as mounts, and
          spirits of fire and wind swore loyalty beneath Primordial banners.
        </p>

        <p>
          But power is a flame that consumes its bearer. The Primordials turned against one another,
          and their wars cracked the world open. Continents split, seas vanished,
          and countless civilizations were erased in their ambition.
        </p>

        <p>
          At last, even the gods feared them. Not out of hatred, but necessity,
          they shattered the Primordial unity. Some vanished into exile, some were cursed into new forms,
          and others were destroyed completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, few remain. Their names are spoken in whispers.
          And when such a being draws a blade, destiny itself bleeds.

        <h3>🌿 Forest Elves — Children of the Living Green</h3>

        <p>
          When the Primordial wars ended, some elves refused to continue on a path of destruction.
          They turned away from stone and fire, seeking peace beneath the trees.
        </p>

        <p>
          These elves became one with the wild. Slightly shorter than their ancestors,
          yet faster and more agile, the Forest Elves are masters of nature and survival.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their golden hair and blue eyes mirror sunlight and sky,
          while their green garments blend into leaves and shadow.
          They dress in silver and gold markings that honor the old blood without worshipping it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forest Elves carry bows not as weapons, but as extensions of their spirit.
          Each arrow is guided not by muscle alone, but by the will of the forest itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          They use nature magic not to dominate the land, but to speak with it.
          Roots rise to protect them. Animals warn them. Rivers remember their names.
        </p>

        <p>
          To the Forest Elves, cutting a tree without need is a crime greater than murder.
          Their loyalty is given to earth, not throne.
        </p>

        <h3>🌑 Void Elves — Children of the Endless Dark</h3>

        <p>
          The Void Elves are the great mystery.
          Some believe they were cast away by the gods.
          Others claim they chose exile willingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          They traveled into realms where light does not exist.
          Where sound dies, and time collapses.
          Where reality itself becomes thin.
        </p>

        <p>
          There, the darkness whispered.
          Not in words, but in hunger.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their skin became pale as frost, and their eyes glowed like trapped spirits.
          A violet aura lingers around them, as if the void itself followed wherever they walked.
        </p>

        <p>
          They dress in black and silver and move like shadows through solid walls.
          Assassins, spies, silent executioners.
        </p>

        <p>
          They drain life, silence thought, and erase light from the world.
          They are not evil…
          they are empty.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one knows if they still remember who they were before exile.
          Or if they simply wait…
          for the void to finish consuming all things.
        </p>

      <h3>🌌 The Broken Bloodline</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primordials</strong> carry the guilt of a broken world.</li>
        <li><strong>Forest Elves</strong> protect what survived.</li>
        <li><strong>Void Elves</strong> embody what was lost.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All elves come from the same flame.
        Some became light…
        Others chose shadow.
      </p>

      <p>
        And as long as one elf still breathes,
        the ancient war has not truly ended.
